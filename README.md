## Description

Added functionality to my existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

- As a user, I will be able to add expenses and deposits to my budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, it should populate the total when brought back online.
- As an avid traveller, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.
